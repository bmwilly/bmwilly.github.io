# Contributing Guide

## Prerequisites

Install Python 3 and Docker.

## CLI

We use the `Makefile` as a poor man's CLI.

The commands can be seen with `make help`:

```shell
$ make
help                 print make target descriptions
build                build docker image
run                  run docker image in interactive mode
serve                serve jekyll site
```
